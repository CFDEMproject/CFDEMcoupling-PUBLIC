Release notes for PUBLIC, version 3.8.1

Updated CFDEMcoupling-PUBLIC to be compatible with OpenFOAM-6 ensuring
functionality on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04.

This updated version and all tutorials are still compatible to LIGGGHTS-PUBLIC 3.8.0

While this update contains some bugfixes and improvements, the main intention of this
update is keeping CFDEMcoupling usable also on newer systems where the compilation of
older OpenFOAM versions may prove difficult.

Note: On Ubuntu 24.04 set / export the environment variable WM_CXX_STD=c++14
before starting the OpenFOAM-6 compilation.
