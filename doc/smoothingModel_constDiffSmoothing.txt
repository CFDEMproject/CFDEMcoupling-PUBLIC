smoothingModel_constDiffSmoothing command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in couplingProperties dictionary.

smoothingModel constDiffSmoothing;
constDiffSmoothingProps
\{
    lowerLimit number1;
    upperLimit number2;
    smoothingLength lengthScale;
    smoothingLengthReferenceField lengthScaleRefField;
\} :pre

{number1} = scalar fields will be bound to this lower value :ulb,l
{number2} = scalar fields will be bound to this upper value :l
{lengthScale} = length scale over which the exchange fields will be smoothed out :l
{lengthScaleRefField} = length scale over which reference fields (e.g., the average particle velocity) will be smoothed out. Should be always larger than lengthScale. If not specified, will be equal to lengthScale. :l
:ule

[Examples:]

constDiffSmoothingProps
\{
    lowerLimit 0.1;
    upperLimit 1e10;
    smoothingLength 1500e-6;
    smoothingLengthReferenceField 9000e-6;  
\} :pre

[Description:]

The "constDiffSmoothing" model is a basic smoothingModel model which reads a smoothing length scale being used for smoothening the exchange fields (voidfraction, Ksl, f if present). This model can be used for smoothing explicit force coupling fields, as well as implicit fource coupling algorithms.
Smoothing for reference fields is performed to "fill in" values in cells in which these reference fields are not specified. Values calculated in the cells (via Lagrangian-To-Euler mapping) are NOT changed! These reference fields are, e.g., the average particle velocity, which are not specified in all cells in case the flow is rather dilute.

[Restrictions:] This model is tested in a limited number of flow situations. 

ATTENTION: In case a smoothing model is used in conjunction with "PimpleImEx" solvers, the fields "f" and "fSmooth" must be placed in the initial time directory! This is because zeroGradient boundary conditions for the fields "f" and "fSmooth" must be specified, otherwise the smoothing operation will give an Error.
