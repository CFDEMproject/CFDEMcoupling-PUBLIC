dataExchangeModel model; :pre

[Examples:]

dataExchangeModel twoWayFiles;
dataExchangeModel twoWayMPI; :pre

NOTE: This examples list might not be complete - please look for other models (dataExchangeModel_XY) in this documentation.

[Description:]

The data exchange model performs the data exchange between LIGGGHTS® and the cfdemCloud within CFDEM®coupling toolbox. The exchanged data at least consits of positions, radii, velocities and forces.

The twoWayMPI model is considered as the standard model, whereas the file-exchange is much slower and its purpose is debugging.

[Restrictions:]

None.
