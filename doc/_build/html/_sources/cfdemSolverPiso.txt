cfdemSolverPiso command
=======================

Description
"""""""""""

"cfdemSolverPiso" is a coupled CFD-DEM solver using CFDEMcoupling, an open source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework. Based on pisoFoam®(*), a finite volume based solver for turbulent Navier-Stokes equations applying the PISO algorithm, "cfdemSolverPiso" has additional functionality for a coupling to the DEM code "LIGGGHTS". The volume averaged Navier-Stokes Equations are solved accounting for momentum exchange and volume displacement of discrete particles whose trajectories are calculated in the DEM code LIGGGHTS.
