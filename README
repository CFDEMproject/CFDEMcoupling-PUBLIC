Description
    This code provides models and solvers to realize coupled CFD-DEM simulations
    using LIGGGHTS and OpenFOAM® technology.
    Note:   this code is not part of OpenFOAM®.
            This offering is not approved or endorsed by OpenCFD Limited, 
            the producer of the OpenFOAM® software and owner of the OPENFOAM®
            and OpenCFD®  trade marks.

CFDEM® coupling provides an open source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework 
combining the strengths of LIGGGHTS® DEM code and the Open Source 
CFD package OpenFOAM®(*). The CFDEM®coupling toolbox allows to expand 
standard CFD solvers of OpenFOAM®(*) to include a coupling to the DEM 
code LIGGGHTS®. In this toolbox the particle representation within the 
CFD solver is organized by "cloud" classes. Key functionalities are organised 
in sub-models (e.g. force models, data exchange models, etc.), which can easily 
be selected and combined by dictionary settings.

The coupled solvers run fully parallel on distributed-memory clusters. 

Features are:

- its modular approach allows users to easily implement new models
- its MPI parallelization enables to use it for large scale problems
- the "forum" (www.cfdem.com) on CFD-DEM gives the possibility 
  to exchange with other users / developers
- the use of GIT allows to easily update to the latest version
- basic documentation is provided

The CFDEM®coupling distribution includes the following files and directories:

- "README" file (this file)
- "COPYING" file the GNU General Public License (GPL)
- "DISCLAIMER" file
- "src" directory including the source files of the coupling toolbox and models
- "applications" directory including the solver files for coupled CFD-DEM simulations
- "doc" directory including the documentation of CFDEM®coupling
- "tutorials" directory including basic tutorial cases showing the functionality

Details on installation are given on the "www.cfdem.com" website.

The functionality of this CFD-DEM framwork is described via "tutorial cases" showing 
how to use different solvers and models.

CFDEM®coupling stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) -
Discrete Element Method (DEM) coupling.
